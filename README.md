A special thanks to [Prof. Stefano Berretti](https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/stefano-berretti/), for introducing me to the discipline at the University) and  [Joey DeVries](https://learnopengl.com/), the project is based on his framework! 
It was initially made in collaboration with @rickie95 as a course project, but even after the delivery I decided to keep working on it implementing the volumetric clouds rendering, with the hope that I'll have the time (and the will!) to add other features!
